# flutter_listview

Implementation of ListView in Flutter

## Getting Started
<p>We’ll start by creating an empty project. Click on File -> New Flutter Project, and create a flutter application.</p>
<p>You’ll notice some code in the main.dart file, delete all of it. We’ll be creating a new app from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s start by adding an external package that we will be using in the project. Expand the project folder in the left-hand project pane. You’ll find a file named pubspec.yaml, think of this as the gradle file for flutter. This is where you add your dependencies for flutter projects.</p>

<p>We’ll be adding a library to generate random words to display in our listview. Copy and paste the code below.</p>
