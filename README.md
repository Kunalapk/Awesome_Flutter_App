<h1>What is Flutter?</h1>
<p>Flutter is google’s mobile app SDK (software development kit) for making native interfaces for both Android and iOS devices using a single code base. So we write code once and then we can deploy on both the different software devices.</p>

<p>The whole flutter UI and UX features are in correspondence to the Google’s Material Design Concept. Each UI element on the app will be categorised as widget’s.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multi Platform - Android & IOS</li>
  <li><b>High performance & low latency</b></li>
  <li>DART as main language</li>
  <li>open-source / github</li>
  <li>"flutter" frame render / rapid variation of signal paramenters</li>
  <li>not a monolith structure - (access to,all control over,all layers of the system)</li>
  <li>Custom ui rendering engine</li>
</ul>
